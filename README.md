# Superizer2.0 Capital One Challenge
This is my solution to the Article Summerization Challenge for Capital One. It provides the name of the Article that you want summarized as well as 6 lines of summarized text. This app also providies a browser that does not make use of the genric android broser to carry out commands.

# Install
I myself do not have an android phone at the time to test the app with but I used Genymotion (an Android Studio emulator plugin). Here are steps to install:

1. Make sure you have Android Studio installed on your desktop (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

2. Download Genymotion to your desktop (its free for indvidual use, choose the basic plan; https://www.genymotion.com/) and install

3. Install the plugin for Genymotion on Android Studio

4. Open up the Genymotion desktop application and add a device you want to emulate on (I recommend Google Nexus 5 - 6.0.0 - API 23 - 1080x1920)

5. Now open the Genymotion plugin and  select a path for the Genymotion plugin to open the app (/Applications/Genymotion.app something like this)

6. Start the Emulator.

# Running the App

1. Download the Zip file and unzip it

2. Open Android Studio and open the unziped file

3. Open any main activity and run the app via the Genymotion emulator

# Features

The App has 2 main Activities; 1 for the summary view and the other for the original view

| Summary  | Original |
|---|---|

The Original View is includes a webbrowser that loads Google implicitly. You can search for articles via the url bar or google.
When you get an articles url you want to summarize copy it (includding the http protocol) and click Search in the Summary view!
Here are some sample runs:

In conclusion, my app provides you with the power to summarize long articles into 6 concise senteces and also provides you with the authors name. I will continue to innovate this ap and add other features like keywords and direct linking. Have fun summarizing!!!
